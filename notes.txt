"-\_("/)_/- it works on my machine" shirt prof is wearing is great - find out where to get something like it.

comments criteria:
	*make sure there is no space for people to misunderstand what the code does.

GIT/GITHUB
	git commit saves local version
	push - updates repo
STEPS FOR PROJS/HW/ETC:
	first step: create proj
	2nd step: setup version control
	3rd step: create a repo on github
note to self: Figure out how to do this on the terminal

finish writing tests for reduce_fraction

add condition to make sure x/0 returns an error for reduce fractions & that negative stays if given a negative fraction

revisit lecture to see to_string implementation to make sure did it correctly

good quiz question: why run test first / why write test first

MAKE IT WORK FIRST ! then optimize
